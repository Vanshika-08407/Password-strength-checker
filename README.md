# Password-strength-checker
The Password Strength Checker is a security-focused tool designed to evaluate the robustness of user-created passwords. It analyzes multiple characteristics of the input password and provides an instant strength rating such as Weak, Moderate, or Strong. The system uses predefined security rules and pattern analysis to help users create safer and more secure passwords.  The checker examines factors including:  Length of the password  Use of uppercase and lowercase letters  Presence of numbers  Use of special characters  Detection of common patterns or repeated characters  Identification of dictionary words or easily guessable sequences  Based on these parameters, the tool generates a score and recommendations to improve the password’s security level. This project helps promote good cybersecurity practices by guiding users to create passwords resistant to brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and common guessing techniques.  It can be implemented using Python, JavaScript, or integrated into authentication systems to enhance overall security.
